# Random Tilings with the GPU
A program for generating random tilings with the GPU, see the companion paper here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07250.pdf. We implement this program using OpenCL. Random number generation on the GPU is done using [TinyMT](https://github.com/MersenneTwister-Lab/TinyMT)


## Examples
See src/examples.cpp for usage examples. The output of these can be found in the folder examples/.
