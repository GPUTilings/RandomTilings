# Random Tilings with the GPU
<img align="right" width="200" src="https://github.com/LittleBadger/RandomTilings/blob/master/TriangleTiling.svg">
Here is an C++/OpenCL library for generating random tilings efficiently with Markov Chain Monte Carlo on the GPU. See the companion paper [1] for further details.  At the moment, the library supports domino tilings, lozenge tilings, bibone tilings, rectangle-triangle tilings, and the six vertex model, and also includes utility functions for constructing domains, maximal/minimal tilings, height functions, Maya diagrams, lattice paths, etc. The program can outputs tilings as [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) or raw as a table suitable for analysis. 

## Prerequisites
In order to build and run the program, you will need the following:
* [OpenCL](http://www.khronos.org/opencl)
* [TinyMT](https://github.com/MersenneTwister-Lab/TinyMT): A library for generating random numbers on the GPU, see [here](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/TINYMT/).
* [TinyMT Parameters](https://github.com/jj1bdx/tinymtdc-longbatch): A list of precomputed parameters for the TinyMT number generator.

## Building And Running
The structure of the library is as follows: . Certain common functionality.

A sample makefile, and several examples are contained in the root folder. To run the example, run:
